        I'm a software developer and digital producer who found my way to tech through journalism. 
        Currently, I work at U.S. News & World Report on web production and front-end development, 
        building digital experiences for a platform that reaches millions of readers.

        My background is a bit of a winding path. 
        I studied Sociology and Journalism at Stony Brook, which gave me a 
        lens for thinking about how technology shapes society and how people 
        actually use the things we build. This fall, I'm starting a master's in 
        Computer Science at Columbia, diving deeper into distributed systems and 
        exploring what a more decentralized web might look like.

       I'm motivated by problems that don't have obvious solutions and the chance to build
        tools that shift power back to users. I'm particularly interested in projects that
         question how we've structured online spaces and whether we can do better.
