        As a digital producer, I sharpened my skills in managing complex 
        projects and implementing front-end technologies, while my degree in 
        Sociology and Journalism from Stony Brook University provides me with 
        insights into user behavior and societal trends. This blend of technical 
        ability and understanding of human engagement positions me 
        to create digital experiences that are both immersive and impactful.
