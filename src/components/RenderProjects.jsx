        <p>Although the Van Tuinens have no official training or licensing, 
        they are part of a broader movement. 
        Therapists and researchers increasingly see psychedelics as an effective 
        way of treating addiction and related issues, and the Food and Drug 
        Administration is nearing approval of MDMA, psilocybin, and other 
        substances in therapeutic settings.

        <p>Interning at the American Museum of Natural History, 
        I contributed to the development of an interactive Kepler Exoplanet Atlas. 
        This digital platform showcases over 2,300 confirmed exoplanets discovered 
        by NASA's Kepler Space Telescope. The atlas explores these distant 
        worlds using data primarily gathered through the transit method, 
        which detects planets as they pass in front of their stars, 
        causing a temporary dimming of light. Users can explore each
        exoplanet's characteristics such as size, temperature, and proximity 
        to its host star, providing a glimpse into the diversity and potential 
        habitability of planetary systems beyond our solar system.

        <p>I reported and wrote an article on Stony Brook University's Member Action Coalition SBU (MAC), 
        a caucus within the United University Professions (UUP) union, challenging the administration's 
        directive for professional staff to return to campus. Despite a statewide telecommuting agreement set to expire, 
        MAC argues the return order poses COVID-19 risks and could disproportionately impact caregivers, women, and people of color. 
        Over 100 individuals signed a petition opposing the return mandate, reflecting widespread concerns within the university 
        community. My reporting for the Stony Brook Press, where I advanced from writer to editor, earned me the Best Student 
        COVID Reporting award from the Long Island Press Club.

        <p>As part of U.S. News & World Report's investing series on megatrends, 
        I contributed by creating ASCII GIFs to bring these concepts to life. 
        These GIFs were designed to add a dynamic and visually compelling element, 
        making trends like AI and the space race more captivating and interactive for readers. 
        Each GIF provided a unique visual perspective, enhancing reader engagement with 
        the future of investing in these transformative areas.

        <p>I developed a clone of Twitter using Django, a powerful web framework in Python. 
        This project involved creating a platform that mimics key functionalities of Twitter, 
        such as user authentication, posting tweets, following users, and real-time updates. 
        By leveraging Django's robust features like ORM for database management, I ensured the clone was scalable and efficient. 
        The project aimed to provide a hands-on learning experience in web development while 
        exploring the architecture and design principles behind a popular social media platform 
        like Twitter.
